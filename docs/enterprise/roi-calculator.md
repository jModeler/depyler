## 🌱 Environmental Impact Calculator

### Carbon Footprint Reduction

#### Current Environmental Impact
```python
# Carbon footprint calculation
servers = 45
power_per_server = 400  # watts average
hours_per_year = 8760
kwh_per_year = servers * power_per_server * hours_per_year / 1000
co2_per_kwh = 0.4233  # kg CO2 per kWh (US average)
current_co2_tons = kwh_per_year * co2_per_kwh / 1000

print(f"Current energy usage: {kwh_per_year:,.0f} kWh/year")
print(f"Current CO2 emissions: {current_co2_tons:.1f} tons/year")
```

**Output:**
```
Current energy usage: 157,680 kWh/year
Current CO2 emissions: 66.7 tons/year
```

#### Post-Migration Environmental Benefits
```python
energy_reduction = 0.855  # 85.5% reduction
post_migration_kwh = kwh_per_year * (1 - energy_reduction)
post_migration_co2 = post_migration_kwh * co2_per_kwh / 1000
co2_savings = current_co2_tons - post_migration_co2

print(f"Post-migration energy: {post_migration_kwh:,.0f} kWh/year")
print(f"Post-migration CO2: {post_migration_co2:.1f} tons/year")
print(f"Annual CO2 savings: {co2_savings:.1f} tons/year")
```

**Output:**
```
Post-migration energy: 22,863 kWh/year
Post-migration CO2: 9.7 tons/year
Annual CO2 savings: 57.0 tons/year
```

### Sustainability Metrics

| Metric | Current | Post-Migration | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **Energy Usage** | 157,680 kWh/year | 22,863 kWh/year | **85.5% reduction** |
| **CO₂ Emissions** | 66.7 tons/year | 9.7 tons/year | **57.0 tons saved** |
| **Equivalent Cars** | 14.5 cars | 2.1 cars | **12.4 cars removed** |
